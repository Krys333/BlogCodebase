# Basic setup

## Install hugo

For reasons I no longer fully remember, I had to install and work with hugo-extended version.
This is broadly related to compatibility with Tailwind at the time of creating the site.

Download the latest extended version of hugo [here](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo?tab=readme-ov-file).

## Install Node Modules
```console
install npm
```
## Run the development server
```console
npm run start
```
The website will can be accessed via 
[localhost:1313](localhost:1313).
