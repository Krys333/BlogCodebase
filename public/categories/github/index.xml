      <description>Outline GitHub Actions are a powerful way of automating your tasks. Often, when you work on a project you will regularly find yourself pushing new updates and features. Naturally then, these changes need to be published in several spaces; be it a GitHub repository, a cloud storage bucket, or anywhere else your code is set to function. This action alone can double and triple your work. This is where GitHub actions can do all the lifting for you.</description>

In my example, I connect my Github repo to a google storage bucket. The idea is that every time I push to my repo, I want some files to be sent to the storage bucket.
In order for this to work, I need to specify sensitive credentials in my code.</description>
